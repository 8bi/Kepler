## Introduction
Kepler is a open source [geo-social](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geosocial_networking) solution that lets users share favorite places and join discussions in real-time. It can be seen as a platform where users can interact with other open data platforms searching across [OpenStreetMap](http://www.openstreetmap.org/about), [Geonames](http://www.geonames.org/) among other sources.
The name as the best Meteor tradition wants to remain in the space field, *Kepler* is inspired by [Kepler space telescope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler_Mission) and wants to be seen as an sequel of the first and largest open source Meteor projects the old *Telescope* actual *[VulcanJS](http://docs.vulcanjs.org/vulcan.html)*.

### Mission
Allows users to collect and georeferencing places on a modern web-mapping interface, describe them accurately, create relationships, sharing with other users and create a social environment. In addition to creating new place you can import pre-existing objects from Openstreetmap creating a social layer over OpenStreetMap.
A place in Kepler can be linked to metadata from different sources automatically, it can be anything that has a geographic location fixed or movable, real or virtual.

### Principles

* **full-stack**: developed 100% in JavaScript using the [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/) the best nodejs fullstack framework.
* **real-time**: all events and changes within the platform are automatically transmitted from the server to the clients
* **geo-social**: the main user interface is a web map contains objects that represent places, users and others
* **framework**: gives developers the ability to extend basic functionalities through an environment and a API
* **extensible**: development is based on an easily buildable plugin architecture

### Expectations
In the near future Kepler as any open source projects will follow a community-driven evolution that will support it instead of the initial mission ad we hope it has growth beyond expectations.

*"Any tool should be useful in the expected way, but a truly great tool lends itself to uses you never expected." Eric S. Raymond*

## Architecture

Kepler uses a [package-based](http://experimentsinmeteor.com/package-based-architecture/) architecture, meaning that the entirety of its codebase resides in [/packages](packages).

#### Base Packages

These packages are indispensable for basic platform operation. And observing dependency relationships should be loaded into this exact order:

* [keplerjs:lib](packages/keplerjs-lib)
* [keplerjs:i18n](packages/keplerjs-i18n)
* [keplerjs:core](packages/keplerjs-core)
* [keplerjs:ui](packages/keplerjs-ui)

#### Plugins packages
The [Kepler plugin packages](#kepler-plugins) provide useful features for your Kepler application. A *plugin package* only need to make your own package depend on *keplerjs:core* or others plugins if needed.

A **Kepler plugin** is a standard Meteor package that contains a **plugin.js** file that defines the behaviors and configuration in the kepler environment, similar in concept to [Package.js](http://docs.meteor.com/api/packagejs.html).


## API
Most of the logic and configuration modules are contained in [keplerjs:core](packages/keplerjs-core/README.md) under the [Kepler namespace](packages/keplerjs-core/Kepler.js) **Kepler.** or **K.** is the same thing. Inside this namespace the general rule is that *Modules* or *Models* are capitalized instead the configuration objects are lowercase.
The views that define the base **User Interface** structure of Kepler are contained in [keplerjs:ui](packages/keplerjs-ui/README.md). This also contains the [helpers templates](packages/keplerjs-ui/client/helpers.js) used by all views and the minimum CSS essential for the behavior of the UI.

##### Models (client)
Define the "Classes" for create new istances of Kepler objects.
For now these are based on the popular John Resig [Class.js](packages/keplerjs-lib/lib/Class.js).
Usually in some kepler plugins these can be extended adding behaviors/methods using files having the same name combined with the name of plugin extends it. (example [Place_pois.js](packages/keplerjs-pois/client/Place_pois.js))
* [K.Place](packages/keplerjs-core/client/Place.js)
   define logic and manage data of the *places* shown on the map and UI
* [K.User](packages/keplerjs-core/client/User.js)
  define logic and manage data of the *users* shown on the map and UI
  
##### Modules (client,server):
Contains *methods*, *subscriptions* and *business logic* that can be used in other parts of the code, often in views, models or other modules.
* [K.Cache](packages/keplerjs-core/modules/Cache.js)
  implement simple and smart general-purpose caching system based on *key-value*
* [K.Plugin](packages/keplerjs-core/modules/Plugin.js)
  define and manage registered *Kepler plugins* in application
* [K.Util](packages/keplerjs-core/modules/Util.js)
  large collection of generic functions, they are organized for categories:
  - [K.Util.humanize](packages/keplerjs-core/modules/Util_humanize.js)
  - [K.Util.sanitize](packages/keplerjs-core/modules/Util_sanitize.js)
  - [K.Util.valid](packages/keplerjs-core/modules/Util_valid.js)
  - [K.Util.geo](packages/keplerjs-core/modules/Util_geo.js) 

##### Modules (client):
* [K.Profile](packages/keplerjs-core/client/Profile.js)
  define methods logic and manage data of the current *logged user*
* [K.Map](packages/keplerjs-core/client/Map.js)
  manages and builds the primary [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/) map
  - [K.Map.controls](packages/keplerjs-core/client/Map_controls.js)
  - [K.Map.layers](packages/keplerjs-core/client/Map_layers.js)
  
##### Configurations (client,server):
Any basic configuration can be extended by plugins with their *plugin.js* file
* [K.schemas](packages/keplerjs-core/modules/schemas.js)
  defines structures for documents in the collections, can be extended by *Kepler plugins* to host the plugin fields
* [K.filters](packages/keplerjs-core/modules/filters.js)
  defines the fields exposed in the queries for pubblications and methods, the structure of this file is deliberately aligned to enhance the different levels of data privacy
* [K.placeholders](packages/keplerjs-core/modules/placeholders.js)
  defines the *placeholders* in the UI where the plugins can extend the content with others *temaplates/views*
* [K.settings](packages/keplerjs-core/settings.js)
  contains the main default settings extended by *Kepler plugins* and from *Meteor.settings*

### UI Placeholders
Kepler implements a convenient mechanism to give plugins the ability to extend the platform's basic structure. 
Using the dynamic template [pluginPlaceholder](packages/keplerjs-ui/client/views/pluginPlaceholder.js) and register the plugin's templates inside the *plugin.js* in the section placeholders.

Here an example of placeholders for the plugin [keplerjs:share](packages/keplerjs-share/plugin.js)
```
K.Plugin({
	name: 'share',
	placeholders: {
		panelPlace: ['panelPlace_share'],
		popupCursor: 'popupCursor_share'
	}
});
```
Any plugin can be define one or many templates for each placeholder.

The placeholders positioned inside the template [panelPlace](packages/keplerjs-ui/client/views/panels/place.html#L45) and
[popupCursor](packages/keplerjs-ui/client/views/popups.html)
```
<template name="panelPlace">
...
	{{> pluginPlaceholder name='panelPlace'}}
...
</template>
```

## Install

Install the latest version of [Node](https://nodejs.org) and [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm).
You can then install [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/install).
Clone or download the [Kepler repo](https://github.com/Keplerjs/Kepler) locally, then:
```sh
npm install
npm start
```
And open *http://localhost:3000/* in your browser.

### Settings
A example of custom settings is [settings.sample.json](private/settings.sample.json) other special settings of individual plugins can be overridden always using this same file.
To see *packages/\<plugin-name\>/plugin.js* file in the *settings* section.

```sh
meteor --settings private/settings.sample.json 
```
