kepler: updated to Meteor 1.5.1.              
                                              
-- Notice --                                  
                                              
1.4.3: The account packages for different services (e.g. facebook, twitter, google, etc.) have been split and now make it possible to avoid
       bundling Blaze in the client bundle for projects not using Blaze. If found in the .meteor/packages file, these packages have been split
       automatically. Assuming there are no other Blaze dependencies, the "<service>-config-ui" package can be removed if there is no need for the
       Blaze configuration interface.
